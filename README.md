# Pong-Fun
A simple arcade game inspired by minimalist design and elementary physics. Your mission in the game is to use the paddle to keep the balls on the screen. With time, more balls are added to the mix to put you through your paces. The game was built to test playersâ€™ divided attention to see how well they can multitask.
